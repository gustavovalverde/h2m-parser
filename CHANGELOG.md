# Changelog

## 0.5.0

### Minor Changes

- 4541105: Refined the htmlparser2 renderer to stream nodes directly, which removes the domhandler dependency and unlocks faster parse times on large fixtures.
  Expose granular `convert_parse`, `convert_render`, and `convert_postprocess` telemetry events (propagated through `H2MParser` and `htmlToMarkdown`) so downstream tooling can pinpoint hotspots while staying backwards compatible.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 9a25c34: Optimize package size and update Node.js requirements

  - Reduce npm package size by 82% (570KB â†’ 103KB) by excluding source maps and enabling minification
  - Remove unused `turndown` dependency, moving it to devDependencies for benchmarks only
  - Update Node.js requirement to >=22 and test matrix to Node 22 and 24
  - Fix tsup config TypeScript error in esbuildOptions
  - Update all GitHub Actions workflows to use Node.js 24
  - Configure package.json to exclude source maps from published package
  - Enable minification in production builds while keeping it disabled for watch mode

  These changes improve installation speed and reduce disk usage for end users while
  maintaining full functionality.
